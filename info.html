  <h1>About TinyQuesadilla</h1>
  <p>Hi! We're TinyQuesadilla, a tiny remote game development studio based out of Columbus and Indianapolis, making games both physical and digital.</p>
  <p>Imagined in 2018 and officially founded in the metaphorical fires of 2020, we are a small team of artists, graphic designers, illustrators, programmers, and gamers.</p>
  <p>We're just here to have a good time and make stuff that we would play, because it's fun.</p>

    <h2>Wren Eli Grey-Hayes</h2>
    <h4>Programming, Copywriting, Narrative and Game Design</h4>
    <p>
      A Neopets veteran, Tamagotchi parent, and frequent nostalgic for the halcyon days of EverQuest2, Wren drinks cold brew coffee like their life depends on it.
      By day, they are a database administrator, and at night, they cook and then they mess around with code until it works.
      They like to see how long they can go without using a mouse, how much of a job can be automated, and how often they can get away with using shatterdive.
      Their favorite programming language is Python, their favorite IDE is VSCode, and their favorite place to write stories is at a table with friends and half-off appetizers.

    <h2>Robyn K. Hayes</h2>
    <h4>Art, Illustration, Assets and Narrative Consultation</h4>
    <p>
      Robyn has always loved drawing, and eventually got really good at it, and now everyone asks her to draw stuff for them. 
      Robyn loves milk tea, plants, and all things miniature, and she keeps a great many Twitter patrons happy with thoughtful, heartfelt art of original and established characters.
      She got into Graphic Design professionally a few years ago after getting her degree in it, but is working towards a full-time career in the games industry.
      Her current setup includes a Samsung tablet, a spot on the floor in front of a heater, and a delightful array of fan merchandise for games like Destiny 2, Portal, and Death Stranding.
      Find Robyn on LinkedIn here.

    <h2>Cal Grey-Mealey</h2>
    <h4>UI/UX, Graphic Design and Brand</h4>
    <p>
      If he's not staring at his chihuahuas or listening to a podcast, Cal is probably playing a FromSoft game or trying to round up enough people to do a raid in Destiny 2.
      Cal is a graphic designer whether it is or isn't convenient, designing brands and helping Wren do UX and UI in exchange for pdf-scraping Python scripts and dinner.
      Cal is fond of long walks in the city, extra shots of espresso, and playing dress-up in every game they own, including the ones that are supposed to be about combat.
      His skills include worrying, doing very accurate impressions, drawing D&D characters, and making sure that thought is given to the order of things.
      Find Cal on LinkedIn here.

    <h2>Widget and Gizmo</h2>
    <h4>Shop Dogs, Moral Support, Friends</h4>
    <p>
      Widget is a little old lady at heart and also for real. Her favorite thing is sleeping, preferably in the least convenient spot she can find.
      Her buggy-eyed charm and snippy demeanor have accompanied the TinyQuesadilla Team through many changes of studio location, and she is a constant source of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gizmo is the baby of the family, having been adopted from a rescue during the COVID-19 pandemic and thenceforth having to learn how to stop yelling at everything.
      He is very fond of his basket full of squeaky toys, peanut butter-oat treats, and going for walks as long as you're confident about where you're headed.
